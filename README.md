# NLSpec

This repo contains analysis of NLSpec, or Natural Language Specification. This format is (I think) first seen in the wild in https://github.com/strongdm/attractor.

This repo contains a spec of NLSpec, in the form of an NLSpec.

# Contributing

I don't know what to expect from this, but I would like to see tooling, SKILLs etc around:

- validating specs
- generating spec from brainstorm type discussions
- splitting spec into layers
- merging specs into one
- adding new requirements to existing specs
- converting specs into plans, especially beads.

# Credits

- The [team at StrongDM][strongdm-factory], who might have a similar spec for a NLSpec.
- [jhugman][jhugman], who extracted the patterns and generated the spec from the exemplars provided.
